title: "A Novel Design for a Compliant Mechanism Based Variable Stiffness Grasper Through Structure Modulation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/10.1115/1.4049309
excerpt: 'This research details the design of a novel variable stiffness grasper that can perform both force and form closure grips through a simple mechanical input. This design uses the principle of stability of truss structures. The grasper behavior is modeled using finite element analysis (FEA) and validated experimentally. Our results demonstrate that structural transformation of flexible elements is a potential solution for achieving variable stiffness in a grasper.'
