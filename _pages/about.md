Hello there! My name is Adarsh Somayaji. Welcome to my home on the web. 

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota and a member of the McAlpine Research Group. My research focuses on applying materials science and programming to develop a generalizable workflow for 3D printing organ models with desired structural and mechanical properties. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a B.Tech and M.Tech in Engineering Design with a specialization in Biomedical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I am excited by the potential impact of robotics and 3D printing in the field of healthcare, particularly in developing medical devices that can be used in surgery, diagnosis, and rehabilitation. I enjoy studying human physiology and developing models that explain the inner workings of this very complex system.
